const myArr = [1,2,3]

const myHeros = ["superman","dad"]

const myArr2 = new Array(1,2,3)

//Array Methods

//myArr.push(6)
//myArr.pop()

//myArr.unshift(9) matlab first position par daalna 9 ko, not that efficient but does the job
//myArr.shirt() remove the first element of the array

//includes and indexof

// const newArr = myArr.join();  this converts the myArr into string format and save it into newArr variable

//slice vs splice 
//in splice closing bracket value is also considered also the values are splices/removed from the original array

//in slice the closing bracket value is not considered and the values are not removed from the original array
